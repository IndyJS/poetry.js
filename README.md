poetry.js
=========

This is a collection of poems and short stories using JavaScript as the medium.

A major goal for this project, beyond simply exploring expressive metaphors and devices in JavaScript, is to progressively enhance the normal text with embedded meaning and flow control (similarly to the way vocal music enhances the text).

This is a prerequisite in order to allow the project to be accessible to the mainstream.

variation1.js was my very first poem in js, created in March of 2011. It's admittedly emo, but I am pleased with its use of flow control and prototype vs own properties to illustrate that all-too-common case of holding on to your pride beyond your best interests.
