#### Artist Statement
This was my first poem in JavaScript. This one was created to explore human/personal potential, imperfection, and redemption through the concept of the prototype and own properties. Following the execution of the poem, you can see that we quickly end up in an infinite loop on line 6, forever approaching "healing" on line 7, but never able to achieve it. After all, we have entered into the loop and there's nothing within the loop affecting the state variables. 

The tragedy of this scenario, though, is going back to root causes. Tracing backwards, the  condition for the loop is an existential check of take which was initially copied over, just before moving into the function, from my.hate. This is the heart of the poem. As a normal Object, my contains a very standard prototype. But its defining feature, in this scenario, is its lack of a hate property. Restoration back to the prototype, the Platonic form, the ideal potential is something as simple as a delete operation, but instead we move to line 6, check, and loop.
