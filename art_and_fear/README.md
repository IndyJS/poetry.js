#### Artist Statement
Originally, I wrote this poem about a very personal struggle. My wife and I were struggling to come to terms with the inevitability of a certain surgery for our infant daughter. From all the miriad friends we have in the medical community, this was no big deal. We were overreacting to what was a very safe and common surgery. But the problem with probability in the human mind is that it's never just a number and math but it's instead a likelihood of something that is a very understandable story. Looking at our program, we have what is very clearly infinite recursion. This is a really bad state and can lead only to either an infinite loop or a stackoverflow exception. Either case is a broken program. But if you look past the potential, you see this program has nothing to fear. In fact, a deferred parsing optimization in a js engine won't even take the time necessary to look at the contents of whenItHappens. What a wonderful optimization to see the code for what it is.
